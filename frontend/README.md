# Design Considerations:
* **The use of Vite:**
This is a really fast and simple to use build tool for the frontend. It is simple to install and configure, and additionally will install Vue.js during the installation process.
* **The use of Vue:**
This is a JavaScript framework that I am very familiar with. I find it simple to use, and the single file components are really structured and organised. All the JavaScript is broken up into sections that makes the code extremely readable and easy to understand.
* **The use of Tailwind:** This CSS framework is highly customisable and easy to use. The classes defined in this framework make it easy to create a unique feeling website.
